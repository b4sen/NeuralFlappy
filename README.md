# This is an AI playing flappy bird implemented in PyTorch

## TODO:

- [ ] Add distance to top and bottom edge to the network -> 6 input nodes instead of 4?
- [ ] Implement learning algorithm -> Adjust random weights by a number sampled from some distribution
- [ ] Spawn more birds and try to save the best agent's `state_dict()`
- [x] Improve physics -> add linearity to the change of velocity
